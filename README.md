# Hello, I'm Rabia.

I am a senior **Computer Engineering** student based in Istanbul, focusing on the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.

I don't just train models; I enjoy building systems that can "see" and "understand" real-world data. Currently, I am channeling this passion into my capstone project, exploring how AI can ensure food safety in nature.

### 🎯 Current Focus
* **The Capstone:** Building a Deep Learning model to detect **poisonous mushrooms** with high accuracy. (Because foraging shouldn't be a gamble!)
* **Goal:** I aspire to specialize in **Computer Vision** through graduate studies and research, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical Deep Learning and impactful real-world applications.

### 🛠 Toolkit
`Python` `PyTorch` `TensorFlow` `OpenCV` `Java` `Gradio`

# Hello, I'm Rabia. 👾

I am a senior **Computer Engineering** student based in Istanbul, focusing on the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.

I enjoy building systems that can "see" and "understand" real-world data. Currently, I am channeling this passion into my capstone project, exploring how AI can ensure food safety in nature.

###  Current Focus
* **The Capstone:** Building a Deep Learning model to detect **poisonous mushrooms** with high accuracy. (Because foraging shouldn't be a gamble!)
* **Goal:** To pursue a career as an AI Engineer, continuously advancing my skills in generative models and computer vision to contribute to the next generation of intelligent technologies.

### Toolkit
`Python` `Java` `PyTorch` `TensorFlow` `OpenCV` `YOLOv8` `Hugging Face` `Streamlit` `Gradio` `Pandas` `Android Dev`
